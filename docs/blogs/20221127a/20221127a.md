# Use venv with Blender

Install external packages to the python bundled with blender in a safe way (I believe).

## Problem

Some linux distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint have their default python environment that closely works with the OS.
In some cases, using pip directly with blender's bundled python destroys the existing dependency and crash the OS.
(I met a trouble with desktop environment by updating Pillow.)

## My Environment

* Linux mint 21
* Blender 3.3


## Move Blender Python into venv.

To separate the environments, I create a virtual environment with venv and move blender's python environment in it.
It allows us to stay within the familiar way of switching multiple python environments.

* First, create the virtual environment somewhere. I decided to name it `blender3.3`.

```sh
cd where/you/want
python3 -m venv blender3.3
```

* Copy Blender's Python environment.
blender's python is different from ordinal, so you have to copy and overwrite all bundled files to the environment you just created now.
In my case,
```sh
cp -rf blender-3.3.1-linux-x64/3.3/python/*  blender3.3/
```

* Link your environment to Blender.
Remove (or rename for backup) the bundled python directory and replace with the symlink to the new one.
```sh
ln -s blender3.3 blender-3.3.1-linux-x64/3.3/python
```

* At the end, check that Blender works correctly.
You can now activate your new environment, install packages, and load them from blender.
```sh
source blender3.3/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib
```
```python
# in blender's internal console
import matplotlib
```
